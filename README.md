# EDLineEditor
## Introduction:
This Editor is the final design of the course Software Engineering and Calculation I. 

Using the command pattern(reminded by TianChengjiang).
Edited on 9012.1.11: It is ABSOLUTELY not so-called Command Pattern. Just 1000+ lines of shits not collected by GC.
## Problems Now:
+ Complicated dependency relations;
+ Too many codes while no man pays me according to lines
## Future Plan:
* Try some new REs or any way to analyse the command
