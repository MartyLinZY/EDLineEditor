# EDLineEditor
## Introduction:
This Editor is the final design of the course Software Engineering and Calculation I. 

Using the command pattern(reminded by TianChengjiang).
## Problems Now:
+ Complicated dependency relations;
+ Undone SaveArea, causing the ambiguous responsibilities of classes, especially the main class;
+ Too many codes while no man pays me according to lines
## Future Plan:
* finish the class SaveArea;
* Try some new REs or any way to analyse the command
